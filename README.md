Example Makeflow Workflows

This is an repository of sample Makeflows.
Each example has one or more of the following pieces:

- A generator program called make_X which creates a workflow from parameters.  The generator can be used to create workflows of varying sizes.
- An example workflow created by the generator.
- One or more log files that describe the run of the workflow.
